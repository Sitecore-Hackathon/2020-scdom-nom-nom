## Summary

**Category: Meetup**

We are using OOB Sitecore capabilities to power meetup logic:

- List Manager maintains participants in each user group, like `Sitecore London User Group` 

- Whenever a new meetup is created, ExM will be used to dispatch emails by configured template

- Every meetup is created as automation plan so that we can directly manipulate with contacts that are willing to participate in it

- While registration takes place, Analytics gets email facet set, as well as contact get identified

- Future events per either user group, or per geo-spacial search can be located

## Pre-requisites

Does your module rely on other Sitecore modules or frameworks?

- List any dependencies
- Or other modules that must be installed
- Or services that must be enabled/configured

## Installation

Provide detailed instructions on how to install the module, and include screenshots where necessary.

1. Use the Sitecore Installation wizard to install the [package](#link-to-package)
2. ???
3. Profit

## Configuration

How do you configure your module once it is installed? Are there items that need to be updated with settings, or maybe config files need to have keys updated?

Remember you are using Markdown, you can provide code samples too:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<!--
  Purpose: Configuration settings for my hackathon module
-->
<configuration xmlns:patch="http://www.sitecore.net/xmlconfig/">
  <sitecore>
    <settings>
      <setting name="MyModule.Setting" value="Hackathon" />
    </settings>
  </sitecore>
</configuration>
```

## Usage

Provide documentation  about your module, how do the users use your module, where are things located, what do icons mean, are there any secret shortcuts etc.

Please include screenshots where necessary. You can add images to the `./images` folder and then link to them from your documentation:

You can embed images of different formats too:
